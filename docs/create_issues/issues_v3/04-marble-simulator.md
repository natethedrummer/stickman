# Issue 4: Marble Simulator Mode

## Priority
**Low**

## Category
Experimental, Game Mode

## Description
Research and potentially implement a "Marble Simulator" concept. This appears to be an experimental idea that may refer to a physics-based game mode or mini-game.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Research what "Marble Simulator" concept means in this context
- [ ] Design document outlining the proposed feature
- [ ] Determine if this should be a separate game mode, mini-game, or alternative gameplay mechanic
- [ ] If greenlit, implement basic prototype

## Questions to Clarify
- What is the intended "Marble Simulator" concept?
- Is this a physics-based mode where units behave like marbles?
- Is this a reference to another game or genre?
- Should this be integrated into the main game or be a separate mode?

## Technical Notes
- May require physics engine enhancements
- Could be implemented as an alternative game mode accessible from the menu
- Needs further specification before implementation

## Dependencies
None

## Estimated Effort
Unknown - requires clarification
