# Issue 9: Design Better Game Title

## Priority
**Low**

## Category
Branding, UI

## Description
Create a more compelling and memorable game title that better reflects the game's theme and mechanics.

## Current Title
"Stickman"

## Suggested Alternatives to Consider
- "Age of Stickmen"
- "Stickman Evolution Wars"
- "Era Defense"
- "Stickman Ages"
- "Stick Wars: Through the Ages"
- "Evolution War"
- "Base Defense: Age of Stickmen"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Brainstorm multiple title options
- [ ] Get feedback from team/players
- [ ] Select final title
- [ ] Update title in all locations:
  - [ ] README.md
  - [ ] index.html (page title)
  - [ ] Menu screen
  - [ ] package.json
  - [ ] Any documentation
  - [ ] Favicon/icon if applicable

## Technical Notes
- This is primarily a branding/marketing decision
- Should consider the age progression theme (Issue 5)
- Title should be memorable and searchable
- Consider domain name availability if hosting publicly

## Dependencies
- May want to wait for Issue 5 (Age Progression) implementation to inform title choice

## Estimated Effort
Small (1-2 hours for implementation after decision is made)
