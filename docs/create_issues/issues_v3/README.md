# Game V3 Feature Issues

This directory contains individual issue files for each feature idea from the "GAME V3 IDEAS" handwritten list.

## Overview

All issues were parsed from a handwritten note containing feature ideas for version 3 of the Stickman game. Each issue file contains:
- Priority level (High/Medium/Low)
- Category
- Detailed description
- Acceptance criteria checklist
- Technical notes
- Dependencies
- Estimated effort

## Issues by Priority

### High Priority (4 issues)
These should be implemented first as they significantly impact core gameplay:
- [Issue 1: Add Sound Effects](01-sound-effects.md)
- [Issue 2: Add Unit and Combat Animations](02-animations.md)
- [Issue 5: Implement 4-Age Progression System](05-age-progression.md)

- [Issue 11: Implement In-Game Shop System](11-shop-system.md)
- [Issue 13: Display Attack Damage Numbers](13-damage-numbers.md)

### Low Priority (5 issues)
These are "nice to have" features that can be implemented later:
- [Issue 4: Marble Simulator Mode](04-marble-simulator.md) *(experimental, needs clarification)*
- [Issue 9: Design Better Game Title](09-better-game-title.md)
- [Issue 10: Implement Dynamic Weather Conditions](10-weather-conditions.md)

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with High Priority items** - Focus on sound effects, animations, age progression, and difficulty levels as these form the core of V3
2. **Consider dependencies** - Issue 5 (Age Progression) affects several other issues, so implement it early
3. **Group related work** - Implement visual enhancements together (animations, backgrounds, weather)
4. **Test as you go** - Each feature should be tested and balanced before moving to the next
5. **Get feedback** - Some items like Issue 4 (Marble Simulator) and Issue 9 (Game Title) need clarification before implementation

## Notes

- Original handwritten list numbered items 1-14, but item 2 appeared to have strikethrough
- Some details are interpretations from handwriting and may need clarification
- Estimated efforts are rough approximations and may vary based on implementation approach
- All issues are independent unless specifically noted in dependencies
