# Issue 6: Create Age-Specific Building Types

## Priority
**Medium**

## Category
Progression, Visuals

## Description
Design different base/building appearances for each age to enhance the visual progression and thematic consistency as players advance through eras.

## Building Types by Age
1. **Stone Age** - Cave entrance or primitive hut
2. **Middle Ages** - Castle or fortress
3. **Modern Age** - Military bunker or command center
4. **Future Age** - High-tech facility or space station

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create visual designs for 4 different base types
- [ ] Each base type is visually distinct and appropriate to its age
- [ ] Base graphics are used for both player and enemy bases
- [ ] Bases scale appropriately and maintain hitbox consistency
- [ ] Base destruction animations fit the theme
- [ ] HP bars and UI elements work with all base types

## Technical Notes
- Replace or extend current base rendering code
- May use sprite sheets or separate images for each age
- Ensure collision detection works consistently across all base types
- Consider whether bases upgrade visually as they take damage

## Dependencies
- Requires Issue 5 (Age Progression System) to be implemented

## Estimated Effort
Medium (5-7 hours)
