# Issue 3: Add Background Graphics

## Priority
**Medium**

## Category
Visuals

## Description
Replace the current plain background with proper background graphics to make the game more visually appealing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Layered parallax background (multiple layers moving at different speeds)
- [ ] Ground/terrain graphics
- [ ] Sky graphics with clouds
- [ ] Environmental details (trees, rocks, etc.)
- [ ] Background should match the current age/era theme
- [ ] Background scrolls properly with camera movement
- [ ] Performance is maintained with background graphics

## Technical Notes
- Use Phaser's tilesprite or image layers for background
- Implement parallax scrolling at different rates for depth
- Consider creating different backgrounds for each age (ties into Issue 5)
- Background should be behind all game elements

## Dependencies
- May tie into Issue 5 (Age Progression) for age-specific backgrounds

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-6 hours)
