# Issue 14: Unlock Special Bird Characters After Level 8

## Priority
**Low**

## Category
Progression, Units

## Description
Add special bird-themed character units that unlock after players complete certain levels (levels 1-4 or after beating level 8, to be clarified).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Design unique bird-based units with distinct abilities
- [ ] Bird characters have special abilities that differentiate them from regular units
- [ ] Unlock condition is clearly defined (requires clarification - see Questions section)
- [ ] Visual distinction from regular units (bird sprites/appearance)
- [ ] Bird units are balanced with existing units
- [ ] Unlock notification/celebration when birds become available
- [ ] Birds persist as unlocked after achievement

## Bird Character Ideas
- Flying bird (can avoid ground units?)
- Dive-bombing bird (high damage attack)
- Support bird (buffs nearby units)
- Eagle/hawk (strong melee)
- Parrot/crow (ranged attacks)

## Questions to Clarify
- How many bird characters should there be?
- What are their specific abilities?
- Should they cost more gold than regular units?
- Are they available in all ages or specific ages?
- Exact unlock condition: complete levels 1-4, or beat level 8?

## Technical Notes
- Add bird unit types to unit configuration
- Create bird sprites/animations
- Implement unlock system based on level completion
- Store unlock status in persistent storage
- Add to unit selection UI when unlocked
- Balance stats and gold cost appropriately

## Dependencies
- May tie into Issue 5 (Age Progression) for age-appropriate birds
- Related to Issue 11 (Could be shop items instead of level unlocks)

## Estimated Effort
Medium (5-7 hours)
